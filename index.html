      <p> This dog reminds me of my own.</p>
      <p>Dogs are my all time favorite animals in the world. I had 2 dogs but one of them died (RIP Jada). Now i have one left and he is a chihuahua too; He's the same color as the one pictured above. His name is Chico and i love him so much, i would do anything for him. I don't know how old he is but he was fully grown when we got him back in 2009. He's my only dog left and i cherish him everyday. He's seems vicious but he's really sweet.</p>

      <p>Drums</p>
      <p>Ok so this is my all time favorite instrument and it's one of my hobbies. I LOVEEEE playing the drums so much, i plan on adding it to my future. I got my first experience playing drums through my auntie. She's a drummer as well and i spent a lot of time at her house when i was younger. She knew that i would be going to an arts high school so she bought me my first drumset. It's cranberry red and i love it.</p>
